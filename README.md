# OperatingSystems

The Gaming Room wants to create a game called Draw It or Lose It, that will be able to function across 
all platforms, mobile devices included. Identifying the design constraints, what was needed from the developers in order to successfully create the game, and what could be considered a roadblock to completing those tasks, was the section of this document that came easiest. Working through a design document lays out all of the requirements and all of the available options that need to be considered before development begins.

Given the chance to revise the design document, I would go back and dive deeper into the Development Requirements for each of the given operating systems. In my opinion, that section lacks the depth necessary to be considered for an actual product. The user's needs, ease of use and visual appeal, are one of the most important things to consider when designing a product. Otherwise, you are wasting time and resources on a product that no one wants to use. Like this design document, in the future I will take a step by step approach to analyze and compare different options available to design software.
